## Info

The repository contains the code for the experiments conducted for the book chapter:

**Emulating Ecological Memory with Recurrent Neural Networks** in the [the DL4ES book](https://github.com/DL4ES/DL4ES)

We cannot share the datasets used in the experiment publicly, but we share the code for transparency. Contact us if you need access to the data or simulations. We are happy to help / collaborate!

If you need assistance with the code, contact: bkraft@bgc-jena.mpg.de
